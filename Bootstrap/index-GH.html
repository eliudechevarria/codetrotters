                    <b>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper</b>,was an American
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist">Computer Scientist</a> and United States Navy
                    rear admiral.In 1944, he was one of the first programmers of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Mark_I">Harvard Mark I</a>                    computer and invented the first compiler for a computer programming language. She popularized the idea
                    of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of <b>COBOL</b>, one of the
                    first high-level programming languages.

                    <br> Owing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as "Amazing Grace".The
                    U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer
                    <b>USS Hopper</b> was named for her, as was the <b>Cray XE6 "Hopper"</b> supercomputer at <b>NERSC.</b>

                <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
                <p>
                    Hopper was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents,
                    Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of Scottish and Dutch descent,
                    and attended West End Collegiate Church.Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell,
                    an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War.
                    Grace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she
                    decided to determine how an alarm clock worked, and dismantled seven alarm clocks before
                    her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock).For her
                    preparatory school education, she attended the Hartridge School in Plainfield, New Jersey.
                    Hopper was initially rejected for early admission to Vassar College at age 16 (her test
                    scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year. <b>She graduated Phi
                    Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and
                    earned her master's degree at Yale University in 1930.</b>

                    In 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of Øystein Ore.
                    Her dissertation, New Types of Irreducibility Criteria, was published that same year.
                    Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate
                    professor in 1941.

                <h2>Carrer</h2>
                <h3>World War 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Hopper had tried to enlist in the Navy early in the war. She was at age 34, too old to enlist, 
                    and her weight to height ratio was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a 
                    mathematician‍—‌she was a mathematics professor at Vassar College‍—‌was valuable to the war effort. 
                    During World War II in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into 
                    the United States Navy Reserve, one of many women to volunteer to serve in the WAVES. She had to 
                    get an exemption to enlist; she was 15 pounds (6.8 kg) below the Navy minimum weight of 120 pounds 
                    (54 kg). She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at Smith 
                    College in Northampton, Massachusetts. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned 
                    to the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard University as a lieutenant, junior grade. 
                    She served on the Mark I computer programming staff headed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_H._Aiken">
                    Howard H. Aiken.</a> Hopper and Aiken coauthored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the 
                    Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy at the 
                    end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. 
                    <b>Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at 
                    Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.</b>
                </p>
                <h3>COBOL</h3>
                <p>
                    In the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together
                    in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL). Hopper
                    served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on
                    the short-term committee that defined the new language <b>COBOL</b> (an acronym for <b>CO</b>mmon 
                    <b>B</b>usiness-<b>O</b>riented <b>L</b>anguage). The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC
                    language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, COMTRAN. <b>Hopper's belief that programs should
                    be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in machine code or in languages
                    close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and
                    COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date.</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the
                    Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of captain in 1973.
                    She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization
                    program for the entire Navy.
