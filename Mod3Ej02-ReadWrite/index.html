                                                <p>The tech industry's diversity problems are exacerbated by its obsession with
                                                    genius coders and brilliant founders, Carissa Romero, a partner at the
                                                    diversity consulting startup Paradigm, said today at TechCrunch Disrupt
                                                    NY. Romero, who took part in a panel of diversity advocates, said that
                                                    the mentality that geniuses are born rather than created through experience
                                                    and practice can be alienating for people who don't fit the stereotype
                                                    of the average tech worker: young, white, straight male, probably rocking
                                                    a hoodie. Diversity - or the lack of it - became a major focus in tech
                                                    several years ago when companies like Google and Facebook followed Pinterest's
                                                    lead and released hard data about the gender and racial makeup of their
                                                    workforces. The numbers confirmed the well-worn stereotype that tech
                                                    companies are mostly staffed by white men, and kicked off conversations
                                                    about how to level the playing field. But now, those conversations have
                                                    started to shift. With hard data out on the table, companies have started
                                                    to diversify their new hires and are beginning to focus on building inclusive
                                                    cultures so they can retain staff. Erica Baker, an engineer and diversity
                                                    advocate at Slack, and Danielle Brown, head of diversity and inclusion
                                                    at Intel, joined Romero in that conversation today at TechCrunch Disrupt
                                                    NY.

                                                <p>You never know what you're going to get when you sit down with Parrot CEO
                                                    Henri Seydoux. The executive is every bit as unpredictable as the company
                                                    he runs - and just like Parrot's products, he always puts on a good show.
                                                    Seydoux's panel at Disrupt today was largely focused on the company's
                                                    drone business, but took some interesting zigs and zags along the way,
                                                    particularly toward the end when he let the audience in on some of his
                                                    more interesting plans for the future, including a rethink of one of
                                                    the most ubiquitous articles of clothing out there. "I am working on
                                                    a t-shirt," Seydoux told the audience toward the end of the conversation.
                                                    "I've been working on it for two years." The executive added that he
                                                    hoped to be showcasing the product at this event a few years from now.
                                                    Seydoux didn't offer much in the way of specifics, due most likely to
                                                    the project's relative infancy, but added confidently, "I'm working on
                                                    a t-shirt that youâ€™ve never seen before." The exec confirmed the product
                                                    backstage - we mostly just wanted to make sure we were hearing things
                                                    right, given Parrot's previous focus on drones, audio accessories and
                                                    you know, things that aren't t-shirts.

                                                    presentations will never bore students again. Instead, he wants to see
                                                    cutting-edge technologies and interactive content become standard tools
                                                    of the teaching trade. To that end, Nearpod has raised $9.2 million in
                                                    Series A funding led by Reach Capital to help teachers use mobile tech
                                                    for live instruction, rather than telling their students to put their
                                                    phones away. Kovalskys says, "Seventy to eighty percent of high school
                                                    students in the U.S. have their own smartphone. And forty percent of
                                                    students have some sort of access to mobile devices in class through
                                                    school programs alone." Nearpod's app lets teachers deliver digital lessons
                                                    to students right on their mobile devices, during class.

                                                <p>Image management and distribution platform Musikki raised a first round of
                                                    funding in 2014 to become "the IMDB of music". It's now inked a deal
                                                    on another $1M in funding from Portugal Ventures, the biggest VC in Portugal.
                                                    It's also launching Exclusiph, an image management and distribution tool
                                                    for the music industry, already in use by independent labels 4AD and
                                                    Secretly Group. Exclusiph enables the distribution of images to any channel
                                                    with one file upload. This then automatically generates the image for
                                                    print, as a digital download, and allows it to be embedded online. Credits,
                                                    music metadata and related content like press releases, video and audio
                                                    links can all be added to the image file. That makes it a useful tool
                                                    for album promotion. Right now London-based Musikki competes with Allmusic,
                                                    Discovr, Echonest and Rovi on the data and B2B side. The tool was developed
                                                    in conjunction with independent label 4AD and is now being used by labels
                                                    like Secretly Group, which features artists like Destroyer and Sharon
                                                    Van Etten.
