            shooting club and developed into an amateur sharpshooter, while working as a
            grinder at the Kiev Arsenal factory. In 1937, as a student of Kiev University

         were not yet accepted". There she became one of 2,000 female snipers in the Red Army, of
         whom about 500 survived the war. She made her first two kills as a sniper near Belyayevka,
